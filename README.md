Delilniki
===
A Flask app to track heat and water consumption (manually).

Just download and run, I even supplied some data, so that it shows things write away.

This app was born out of necessity, because I don't trust my building warden. 

Delilniki is now in development stage. If you want to use it with more sensors 
(water clocks, calorimeters, ...), you must manually add them to database and fix the source so it supports additional 
inputs, form, calculations,...
 
My goal is to develop it so it will support multiple users, dynamically adding of sensors, customizable graphs and output fields.
